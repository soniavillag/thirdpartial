"""
Objective. Algorithm for obtaining zoo statistics.
Create an algorithm to obtain statistics in a zoo where a count and percentage of “n” animals
within a certain age range is required:
Less than 2 years
Between 2 and less than 5 years
Between 5 and less than 10 years
Greater than or equal to 10 years
The diagram should ask as input: if there is another animal to be recorded (yes/no
response), the age (years) of each one. Tip: use the lower function to validate yes and no
The output must specify the number and percentage of animals in each age range.
