Get the factorial of a number.
Definition. The factorial of n or n factorial is initially defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Example:
Factorial of 4 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
Factorial of 5 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Input: Number that you want to obtain the factorial

Output: Result of the factorial
